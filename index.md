**Background & Interests:** My areas of research interest lie in
computational geometry, inverse problems, numerical analysis, Voronoi
tessellations, partial differential equations, and whatever else piques my
interest.

Evidence-based pedagogical innovations are also of great interest. Helping
students to engage with mathematics and to develop their mathematical
thinking skills is my favorite thing to do.

# P5JS Sketches

[P5js](https://p5js.org) is a javascript library that allows one to quickly
"sketch" interactive, web-based, graphical apps. This is a gallery of a few
sketches.

1. [Three Body Simulator](https://schuefone.github.io/ThreeBody/). Simulates the 2D motion of 3 masses mutually interacting under the force of gravity.

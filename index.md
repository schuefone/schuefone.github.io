**Background & Interests:** My areas of research interest lie in
computational geometry, inverse problems, numerical analysis, Voronoi
tessellations, partial differential equations, and whatever else piques my
interest.

Evidence-based pedagogical innovations are also of great interest. Helping
students to engage with mathematics and to develop their mathematical
thinking skills is my favorite thing to do.

Welcome to my github page. This is a space I use to share various projects
and ideas I've developed over the years. Enjoy!

# Teaching and Pedagogy
A collection of teaching and pedagogical resources developed teaching
mathematics at a small liberal arts college in the United States since
1996.

## Phone Sensor Math

Here is the [Phone Sensor Math](https://github.com/schuelaw/PhoneSensorMath) site dedicated to ways in which ordinary smart phone sensors (e.g. GPS, accelerometer, etc) can be used to collect data for analysis in calculus and physics classes. Developed with the help of [Ally Collier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ally-collier-4bb421190/).

## Mastery Vector Calculus

In Fall of 2020, we taught completely on-line because of the covid pandemic. Here is the [Mastery-based Vector Calculus](https://github.com/schuelaw/MasteryVectorCalculus) that relies on the MAA's open-source, on-line homework system, [WeBWorK](https://webwork.maa.org/moodle/), and the open-source [Calculus 3 textbook](https://openstax.org/details/books/calculus-volume-3) from OpenStax.

## SageMath Setup and Use

Here are some instructions for [installing and using the SageMath](https://schuefone.github.io/SageMathUse) system on
your computer.  [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/) is a free,
open-source, computer algebra and visualization system.  It's an
alternative to Mathematica or Maple that is built on python and runs in
jupyter environments. You can try it for free at
[cocalc.com](https://www.cocalc.com).
